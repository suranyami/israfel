Israfel
=======

Building Islamic star patterns with RaphaÃ«l and Coffeescript.

Inspiration
-----------

David Parry (@suranyami) introduced me to the concept at Hack Night and had started building it in plain old Javascript. 

I thought it would be a great project to try out coffeescript with.

Design
------

Some of the data structures here were useful: 

[http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/washington/taprats/arch.html]

Usage
-----
So far, there is only some basic computational geometry work in the source.

But for a bit of fun, you could open up `public/index.html` in your browser and
see the Polygon.pointInside algorithm working.


Etymology
---------

The name Israfel comes from the Arabic name for Raphael.
